# CIFAR-10 Convolutional Neural Network Demo

Welcome! This project is a hands-on, beginner-friendly walkthrough for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the famous [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. If youâ€™re new to deep learning or want a practical example, youâ€™re in the right place!

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **Step-by-step Jupyter Notebook (`CNN.ipynb`)**  
  Clear code cells and explanations guide you from data loading to model evaluation and visualization.
- **Modern CNN architecture**  
  Uses TensorFlow/Keras with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers.
- **Live training curves**  
  See how accuracy and loss change as your model learns.
- **Visual predictions**  
  Instantly compare your modelâ€™s guesses to the true labels on real images.
